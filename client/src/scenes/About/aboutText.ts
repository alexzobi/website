const text = "Hi. If you've made it here, you probably know my name already. Just in case, I'm Alex. By day, I am a software engineer. By night I am...still a software engineer... But this is just once piece of the puzzle.\nFirst and foremost, I try to be an advocate. I strive to make my environment welcoming, enjoyable and comfortable for those around me, whether at work or at play. I believe it is everyone's responsibility to hold themselves and their peers to an ethically higher standard in order to ensure the well-being of our communities.\n I believe that communication is the key to success in any relationship, whether it be personal or professional. I try to always practice and encourage an empathetic approach to conversation, as understanding is the key to success in any aspect. I recognize my own priviledge and try to use it to the best of my ability to promote diversity, access, and equity for those with lesser means.\n We have a long way to go as a country and globally. It takes self-reflection, personal accountability, and most importantly an active effort to really make the change possible. We should rely on our leaders to spread the message and give us the tools, but we must push ourselves to actively make the world better than we left it and expect those around us to do the same.\nI started my professional journey as a marine engineer, working on cargo vessels on the Great Lakes, as well as overseas. After years of pivoting, traveling and a quarter life crisis, I discovered my passion for software engineering. Today I try to build products that help people, even if in some small way. I hold my employer to the same expectation.\nOutside of work I have hobbies abound. I like to get my exercise through climbing when possible. I'm a hobby photographer and writer, with a published book, made possible by the hard work of my wonderful partner and a community of people around us that pitched in.\nI am fascinated by all living things, try to reduce my environmental impact where possible, and encourage others to engage with their surroundings in a way that promotes mental and physical health, while protecting the gift of nature."
